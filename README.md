# Introduction 
The project involves the development of a generic OData service that caters to two main use cases. Firstly, it provides OData-compatible HTTP endpoints for RESTful APIs, enabling the retrieval of datasets. Secondly, it automates the creation of OData endpoints for SQL tables.

In the first use case, the OData service allows users to define datasets and exposes them as HTTP endpoints. This enables clients to access and interact with the datasets using standard OData query language and protocols. The service takes care of authentication, authorization, and query processing to ensure data security and integrity.

The second use case focuses on automatically provisioning OData endpoints for SQL tables. By connecting to a SQL database, the service dynamically generates OData endpoints for each table in the database. This eliminates the need for manual configuration and coding, streamlining the process for developers.

Key features of the project include OData compatibility, RESTful API support, query processing capabilities, robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, seamless integration with SQL databases, and comprehensive documentation and testing.

Overall, this project aims to simplify data integration and retrieval by providing a flexible and efficient solution for exposing datasets through OData endpoints. By automating the creation of OData endpoints for SQL tables, developers can save time and effort, resulting in more streamlined application development processes.
